        This file provides backwards compatible mappings for properties, targets,
        and tasks most likely to break as a result of the naming changes
        introduced in Antennae as of 1.2.0.
        
        To use this file see the comments in build-common-imports.xml.
        
        This mechanism should be considered depreciated and will be removed
        in a future release of Antennae.
