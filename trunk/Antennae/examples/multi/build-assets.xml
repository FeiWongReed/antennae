<!--
    Assets definition file for multi-project application.

    This file defines all declared assets in subprojects; the
    definitions are shared across those subprojects so that assets
    exported by one project can be referenced by another,
    without knowing the exact location of the exported asset.

    Note that all paths are defined
    relative to ${root.dir} since we don't know what the current
    directory is in which Ant is running.

    <!-- For convenience, set up the name of the multi directory -->
    <property name="multi.dir" location="${root.dir}/examples/multi"/>
